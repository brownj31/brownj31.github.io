### Ingredients
- $2$ lbs ground beef, portioned into $8$ burgers and seasoned with salt and pepper
- $1$ lb thick cut bacon
- $1$ sweet onion, slivered
- $\frac{1}{2}$ cup brown sugar
- $8$ sesame seed buns
- $1$ pkg [Alouette cheese spread](https://www.kroger.com/p/alouette-garlic-herb-soft-spreadable-cheese/0007144830014?fulfillment=PICKUP&storecode=01600621&&cid=shp_adw_shopl_.FY23.01_search_ent_conv_lia_corelia_kroger_g_lia_shop_acq_evgn_ship_all_roas_deli&gclid=Cj0KCQiA6rCgBhDVARIsAK1kGPJxmr-45Ox-J_PqG65vHUoXBX-TFPwEPjpnpYg4Po-GhQAFiM1vPgoaAnAeEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)

### Directions
1. Cut bacon into small pieces and cook in a skillet over medium-high heat until crispy (about $8$ minutes).
1. Remove bacon from skillet, but leave $2$ tbsp of bacon grease in the pan to cook the onions.  Add slivered onions to the same skillet and cook for $8$ minutes.
1. Reduce the heat to low so the onions can caramelize.  Add $\frac{1}{2}$ cup brown sugar and continue to cook them until they completely caramelize (about $20$ minutes).
1. Add the bacon bits back into the caramelized onions.
1. Smash each burger portion very thin (I use the underside of a pan) and cook for about $1\frac{1}{2}$ minutes per side.
1. Serve by putting a burger on a toasted bun and adding bacon marmalade and alouette cheese spread.
