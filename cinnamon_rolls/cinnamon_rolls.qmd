### Ingredients

##### Dough

-   $1$ loaf frozen [bread dough](https://rhodesbakenserv.com/white-bread-2/), thawed

##### Filling

-   $\frac{1}{2}$ cup light brown sugar
-   $\frac{1}{4}$ cup white sugar
-   $6$ tbsp butter
-   $2$ tbsp cinnamon

##### Cream Cheese Icing

-   $2$ oz Philadelphia cream cheese
-   $3$ tbsp butter
-   $3$ cups confectioners sugar (AKA powdered sugar)
-   $6$ tbsp milk
-   $\frac{3}{4}$ tsp vanilla extract

**Note**: This makes **a lot** of cream cheese icing.

##### Glaze Icing

-   $2$ cups confectioners sugar (AKA powdered sugar)
-   $4$ tbsp melted butter
-   $1$ tsp vanilla extract
-   $3-6$ tbsp hot water

### Directions

1.  Thaw bread dough in refrigerator overnight (per instructions on package). Take it out of the refrigerator about an hour before using it so that it isn't stiff.
2.  Roll dough into a flat rectangle.
3.  Combine filling ingredients in a large bowl, and spread evenly onto the flattened dough.
4.  Roll dough into a a cylinder and cut into $1$" pieces. I like to do this by repeatedly cutting the pieces in half until they are about the right size.
5.  Bake at $350^\circ F$ for $25$ minutes.
6.  Immediately after coming out of the oven, cover with icing of choice from above.
