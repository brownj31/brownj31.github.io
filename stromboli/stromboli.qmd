![](stromboli/stromboli.jpeg){width="300"}

### Ingredients

**Note**: This makes one roll of Stromboli. I normally double the recipe and make 2.

-   $1$ loaf frozen [bread dough](https://rhodesbakenserv.com/white-bread-2/), thawed
-   $8$ oz pepperoni
-   $6$ oz mozzarella cheese slices
-   $3$ oz provolone cheese slices
-   $1$ tbsp Parmesan cheese
-   $2$ eggs (separate yolks from whites)
-   $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp garlic powder
-   $1$ tsp oregano (I normally use Italian seasoning, which has oregano)
-   $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp pepper
-   $2$ tbsp cooking oil
-   $1$ tsp parsley (dried from spice aisle)
-   marinara sauce for dipping

### Directions

1.  Thaw bread dough in refrigerator overnight (per instructions on package).  Take it out of the refrigerator about an hour before using it so that it isn't stiff.
2.  Roll bread dough into $12$" by $18$" rectangle. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper so the bottom of the Stromboli doesn't burn.
3.  In a bowl, combine $2$ egg **yolks**, $1$ tbsp Parmesan cheese, $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp garlic powder, $1$ tsp oregano, $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp pepper, $1$ tsp parsley, $2$ tbsp cooking oil.
4.  Spread the spice and egg mixture (from previous step) onto the $12$" by $18$" rectangle of dough. Cover with $3$ oz provolone cheese slices, $6$ oz mozzarella cheese slices, and $8$ oz pepperoni.
5.  Roll into a cylinder and brush exterior with egg whites. Cut slits in the top of the rolled cylinder and top with oregano.
6.  Bake seam side down at $350^{\circ}F$ for $30$ minutes.
