![](crunchwraps/crunchwraps.jpeg){width="300"}

### Ingredients
**Note**: The ingredients can vary.  This recipe has the ingredients I've used most often.

- $1$ lb ground beef
- $1$ package taco seasoning (I like Taco Bell brand)
- $12$" flour tortillas
- shredded cheese
- canned nacho cheese
- tostadas
- sour cream
- diced tomatoes (I like to use Roma, since they're cheapest per pound)
- taco sauce


### Directions

1.  Cook ground beef in a skillet over medium heat.  Add taco seasoning at the end (per packet instructions).
1. Heat nacho cheese ina small saucepan.
1. Place ground beef in the ceter of a warmed tortilla (I microwave the tortillas for $30$ seconds to make them less likely to break).
1. Add nacho cheese, taco sauce, sour cream, tomatoes then top with a tostada shell.  Add shredded cheese.  **It is important that the shredded cheese is the last thing added, since it will be the glue that holds the crunchwrap together.**
1. Fold the edges of the tortilla up around the tostada and shredded cheese.
1. Cook the crunchwrap seam-side down for $3$ minutes.  Then flip and cook an additional $1$ minute.
