### Directions

4.  Add $1$ sheet of phyllo dough to the baking dish and brush the top of it with butter. Repeat this until there are $14$ sheets of dough stacked on top of each other.
5.  Add the walnut filling on top of the $14^{\text{th}}$ sheet of dough. Add a little bit of butter on top of the filling.
6.  Add $14$ more sheets of phyllo dough on top of the filling, and brush each with butter.
7.  Cut into rectangles.

10. To the saucepan, add $\frac{1}{2}$ cup white sugar, $1$ cup water, $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp salt, and $1$ cup honey.
11. Let the syrup boil, and reduce the heat to medium. Then let it reduce for $5-7$ minutes until it reaches a very light syrupy consistency.
12. When the dough is finished baking, pour the syrup on top of the cooked baklava, and let it cool.
