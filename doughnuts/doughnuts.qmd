## Doughnuts

![](doughnuts/doughnuts.jpeg){width="300"}

### Ingredients

##### Dough

-   $1$ loaf frozen [bread dough](https://rhodesbakenserv.com/white-bread-2/), thawed
- cinnamon sugar

##### Glaze

-   $2$ cups confectioners sugar (AKA powdered sugar)
-   $4$ tbsp melted butter
-   $1$ tsp vanilla extract
-   $3-6$ tbsp hot water

### Directions

1.  Thaw bread dough in refrigerator overnight (per instructions on package). Take it out of the refrigerator about an hour before using it so that it isn't stiff.
2.  Roll dough into a flat rectangle.  Using a drinking glass, cut circles out of dough.  Using the cap of a plastic disposable water bottle, cut out small holes in the middle of each doughnut.
3.  Roll scraps into a new flat rectangle and cut out more doughnuts until there is no dough left.
1. Fill a pot with about $2$ inches of vegetable oil and heat to $350^\circ F$.  **If the oil is too hot, the doughnuts will burn.**  Cook doughnuts for $1-2$ minutes per side, until golden brown.  Cook in batches to avoid overcrowding the pot.
1. Immediately after removing the doughnuts from the oil, dip in glaze, and add additional toppings of choice.  I like to coat with cinnamon sugar.
