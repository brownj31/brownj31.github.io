## Pizza

### Ingredients

**Note**: I often change the toppings. This recipe is for a pepperoni pizza.

-   $1$ loaf frozen [bread dough](https://rhodesbakenserv.com/white-bread-2/), thawed
- $2$ tbsp butter
- $1$ clove garlic, minced
-   1 can of [crushed tomatoes](https://www.kroger.com/p/kroger-crushed-peeled-tomatoes/0001111081548?fulfillment=PICKUP&storecode=01600621&&cid=shp_adw_ob.shopl_.FY23.01_search_ob_conv_ob_ourbrandslia_kroger_g_lia_shop_acq_evgn_ourbrandskro_all_roas_pantry&gclid=Cj0KCQiA6rCgBhDVARIsAK1kGPJTC27H3CNUmDvO_c5MoTBXGexWol5TnGe6U_UR83V7j9LA5Ir96EcaAq5OEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds). Get the smallest can you can find. I normally get 15 oz, and that is too much for $1$ pizza.
-   $3$ tbsp sugar
-   $8$ oz fresh mozzarella, sliced thick
- $8$ oz pepperoni.  I like to buy a stick and cut the pepperonis thick.  That way they curl and get crispy in the oven.

### Directions

1.  Thaw bread dough in refrigerator overnight (per instructions on package).  Take it out of the refrigerator about an hour before using it so that it isn't stiff.
2.  Spray a $10$" cast iron skillet with cooking spray and form the dough to the shape of the skillet.
1. To make pizza sauce add $3$ tbsp sugar to the can of crushed tomatoes.
1. Spread sauce on dough, add mozzarella slices and pepperoni.
1. Bake at $500^\circ F$ for 15 minutes.  Then broil on high for 2 minutes until cheese is golden brown and pepperonis are crispy.
1. Add garlic and $2$ tbsp butter to a bowl and melt in the microwave.  Spread the garlic butter on the pizza crust.
