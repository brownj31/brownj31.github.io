### Ingredients
- $1$ pkg [refrigerated wonton wrappers](https://www.kroger.com/p/nasoya-wonton-wrappers/0002548400006?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&CID=afi.pro.afi_Evergreen-CJ-Affiliates_20230303_b:kroger_c:ship_t:ent&cjevent=7471fa92c72511ef806df6000a82b82c&PID=100357191) (The frozen ones stick too much.)
- $1$ lb ground pork (Don't buy the kind that looks like ground beef; it's much tougher.)
- $1$ green onion
- $2$ garlic cloves, minced
- $2$ tsp minced fresh ginger
- $1$ tsp sesame oil
- $2$ tsp salt
- $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp black pepper
- small bowl of water for folding
- cooking oil


### Directions
1. In a large bowl, mix $1$ lb ground pork, $1$ green onion, $2$ garlic cloves, $2$ tsp ginger, $1$ tsp sesame oil, $2$ tsp salt, and $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp black pepper.
1. Get a small bowl of water.
1. Separate all wonton wrappers and lay them in rows on the counter.
1. Place $1$ tsp of the pork mixture in the center of each wrapper.
1. Wet a finger in the bowl of water and use it to dampen the outer edges of the wonton wrappers.  Fold them corner to corner to form a triangle.  
1. Freeze if desired.  They can be cooked from frozen or immediately after preparation.
1. Cooking these is significantly easier in a nonstick pan.
1. Heat a stainless steel pan until Leidenfrost. Add oil and turn the heat to medium low.  Allow the pan to cool for about 90 seconds.
1. In a single layer, add the potstickers and cook them for $1$ - $2$ minutes until the bottoms are crispy.
1. Add $1$ cup of water to the pan and cover immediately.  Allow the potstickers to steam covered for $6$ - $8$ minutes until all water has evaporated.
1. Remove from pan and serve.
