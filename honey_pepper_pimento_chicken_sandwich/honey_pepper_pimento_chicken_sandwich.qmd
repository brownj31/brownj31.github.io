### Ingredients
- hamburger buns, toasted
- sliced pickles
- $4$ medium chicken breasts (scored on top and bottom)
- vegetable oil (for frying)

#### Brine
- salt
- pepper
- $1$ cup pickle juice

#### Milk Wash
- $1$ egg
- $\frac{1}{8}$ cup milk

#### Breading
- $\frac{1}{2}$ cups corn starch
- $\frac{3}{4}$ cups all-purpose flour
- $2$ tsp paprika
- $1$ tbsp black pepper
- $3$ tsp salt
- $\frac{1}{4}$ tsp cayenne pepper
- $2$ tsp powdered sugar
- $1$ tsp baking powder

#### Spread 
- $1$ container pimento cheese spread
- honey

### Directions
1. Cut chicken breasts in half horizontally, then pound to even thickness (about $\frac{1}{2}$in tall).
1. Generously salt and pepper both sides, then place chicken into a plastic bag and fill with enough pickle juice to cover them (about $1$ cup). 1. Place in refrigerator for exactly $1$ hour.
1. Make breading by mixing the following ingredients:
   - $\frac{1}{2}$ cups corn starch
   - $\frac{3}{4}$ cups all-purpose flour
   - $2$ tsp paprika
   - $1$ tbsp black pepper
   - $3$ tsp salt
   - $\frac{1}{4}$ tsp cayenne pepper
   - $2$ tsp powdered sugar
   - $1$ tsp baking powder
1. After the fillets are done brining, dry each fillet thoroughly, then coat in the breading.  Let rest 5-10 minutes so this coating can bond properly.
1. Make milk wash by combining $1$ egg and $\frac{1}{8}$ cup milk.
1. Drip $3$ tbsp of milk wash into the breading bowl, mixing after each spoonful. We're looking for small droplets randomly distributed throughout the breading.
1. Dredge each fillet in the milk wash, then the breading bowl.  Put in the refrigerator for $20$ minutes to help the breading bond.
1. Heat vegetable oil to $350^\circ F$, using enough oil to cover a chicken breast.
1. Toast hamburger buns.
1. Deep fry each breast for $3$ minutes (until they reach an internal temperature of $160^\circ F$).  Ensure oil's temperature remains close to $350^\circ F$ the whole time.
1. Make the spread by combining $2$ tbsp of pimento cheese with $1$ tbsp of honey.
1. Cover both sides of the bun with spread, place pickle slices on the crown, and top with the fried chicken breast.
